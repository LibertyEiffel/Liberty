Description: The Liberty Eiffel tools source
 Liberty Eiffel is the proud successor of SmartEiffel, also formerly
 known as the GNU Eiffel compiler.
 Since the original maintainer lost interest, and the community has to
 be rebuilt with a new purpose, the name was also changed.
 Note that the name "Liberty" was chosen as a not-so-subtle to the
 Liberty Tower, which innards were designed by Gustave Eiffel, the
 French engineer.
 This package provides the Eiffel source of the Liberty Eiffel tools.
