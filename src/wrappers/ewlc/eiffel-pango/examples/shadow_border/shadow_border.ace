	-- The equivalent of the -cecil flag of the traditional command line mode.
	-- To indicate some cecil file to be considered, update and uncomment
	-- the following lines:
	-- cecil ("my_cecil_file1.se")
	-- cecil ("my_cecil_file2.se")
	-- cecil ("my_cecil_file3.se")

	-- External libraries directory path to be considered; update and uncomment

	-- external_lib_path. Just leave out the -L:
	-- external_lib_path: "/usr/local /foo/bar"
	-- In this case external_lib_path will work on Windows too.

	no_strip(yes);
	-- Yes would mean that you don't want to run "strip" on the generated
	-- executable. This is the equivalent of the -no_strip flag of the
	-- traditional command line mode. (I.e. to use a C level debugger on your
	-- system, you should choose yes here).

	no_split(no);
	-- Yes would mean that you want one big single C file for the complete
	-- system, pinstead of the many small C files produced by default ("no").
	-- This may be useful for delivery of the most efficient version. (Some
	-- C compilers including gcc can then do better inlining.)

	clean(no);
	-- Yes would mean that you want to remove all generated C files, all
	-- generated object files as well as other temporary files generated
	-- during the compilation process. (See also command clean.)

	-- The equivalent of the -cc flag of the traditional command line mode.
	-- To select a different C compiler from the default, update and uncomment
	-- the following line:
	-- cc : "gcc"

	-- To decide which C compiler options are to be passed, you need to use
	-- this keyword as well as a good understanding of your C compiler.
	-- Update and uncomment the following line:
	c_compiler_options : "$(pkg-config --cflags cairo pango pangocairo) -g"

	-- Some options are to be passed only to the linker. Update and uncomment
	-- the following line:
	linker_options : "$(pkg-config --libs --cflags cairo pango pangocairo) -g"

	-- For the equivalent of the -no_main flag of the traditional command line
	-- mode, uncomment the following line:
	-- no_main (yes)

	-- For the equivalent of the -gc_info flag of the traditional command line
	-- mode, uncomment the following line:
	-- gc_info (yes)

	-- For the equivalent of the -wedit flag of the traditional command line
	-- mode. To Include support for the Wedit debugger uncomment the following
	-- line:
	-- wedit (yes)


-- Additional information about system environment variables:
--    Inside manifest strings, you are allowed to use system
--    environment variables using the same notation as in the traditional
--    "loadpath.se" files. Actually, this notation is inspired by the
--    traditional UNIX bracketed notation as for example: ${FOO} or ${Bar}
--    or ${SmartEiffel}.
--
-- Additional information about the ${SmartEiffelDirectory} variable:
--    If not explicitely set by the user, the ${SmartEiffelDirectory} variable
--    is automatically computed using the value of the ${SmartEiffel} variable.
--    (Keep in mind that the ${SmartEiffel} variable is mandatory for using
--    SmartEiffel.)  The computed value indicates the SmartEiffel main
--    directory. For example, if the value of ${SmartEiffel} is
--    "/usr/local/lib/SmartEiffel/sys/system.se"
--    the computed value is "/usr/local/lib/SmartEiffel/". This automatically
--    defined variable ${SmartEiffelDirectory} is useful for indicating the
--    location of the SmartEiffel standard library.
