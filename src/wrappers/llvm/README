Wrappers for Low Level Virtual Machine (www.llvm.org)

Currently based on the C bindings; wrapping an object oriented infrastructure
throught bindings that are meant to be used in a strictly non-OO language
imposes some compromises, like "exposing" C_ARRAYs or providing iterator-based
only access. This should be fixed with a direct interface with C++ after
bootstrap or after wrappers-generator tool will be upgraded to deal with C++.

Currently a new wrapper is created everytime a new pointer is received from the
C library. This is obviously not efficient and does not allow to have
collections of wrappers of LLVM objects otherwise we will violate several
COLLECTION postcondition like those of put feature, but allows for the wrappers
to be a thin layer above the C API in order to avoid strange bugs.

Ideally it should be possible to avoid the usage of wrapper objects.
