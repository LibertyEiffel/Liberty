<a name="be_client"><h3>Be a Client</h3></a>

<p>
To be client means trying to reach some server and getting some data from it.
</p>

<p>
There are two concepts to grasp before making a connection:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Address</b>: that's the network address of a machine (a "host"), given either by its name or its IP
   number. The net cluster knows of three kinds of addresses: the host name, the IP address and the local
   address which represents the local machine.</li>

<li> <b>Access</b>: it allows to connect to some server that runs on a machine and listens on a port. The net
   cluster knows of three kinds of accesses: TCP and UDP access, and the special Local access that reaches the
   local machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be a client, you have to do three things, in that order:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>create an address object</li>
 <li>create an access object, using the address object</li>
 <li>query a stream from the access object</li>
</ul>

<p>
In Liberty Eiffel, you would write it this way:
</p>

<pre>
   connect_to_funet: <a href="index/TERMINAL_INPUT_OUTPUT_STREAM.html">TERMINAL_INPUT_OUTPUT_STREAM</a> <b>is</b>
      <b>local</b>
         funet: <a href="index/HOST.html">HOST</a>
         tcp: <a href="index/TCP_ACCESS.html">TCP_ACCESS</a>
      <b>do</b>
         <b>create</b> funet.make(<b>once</b> "ftp.funet.fi")
         <b>create</b> tcp.make(funet, 21)
         Result := tcp.stream
      <b>end</b>
</pre>

</p>



<a name="be_server"><h3>Be a Server</h3></a>

<p>
To be a server, things are a bit more complex but not tremendously so.
</p>

<p>
First note that you must know something of the <a
href="_summary@lib.sequencer.html"><code>lib/sequencer</code></a> cluster. You must also be familiar with
agents.
</p>

<p>
To create a server, start by creating an address and an access. The address will filter which connections are
allowed<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>, and the access port will determine which port the server
will listen to.
</p>

<p>
Now you must create a <a href="index/SOCKET_SERVER.html"><code>SOCKET_SERVER</code></a>, give it one or more
agents using the <code>`when_connect'</code> feature. Those agents are called whenever a new client connects;
each agent is given the same stream that represents the connection to the client.
</p>

<p>
Note that having multiple agents is <i>potentially dangerous</i>.  Either all the agents cooperate, either
having one registered is enough. Remember that all agents share the same stream.
</p>

</p>
At last, start the sequencer (see the <a href="_summary@lib.sequencer.html"><code>lib/sequencer</code></a>
cluster and tutorial).
</p>

<p>
You also want to look at the <a href="_summary@lib.net.servers.html"><code>lib/net/servers</code></a> cluster.
</p>

<p>
(See also the tutorial: class <code>MULTIPLEX_SERVER</code>)
</p>


<a name="use_server"><h3>Use a standard Server</h3></a>

<p>
Liberty Eiffel provides (or will provide) some standard servers, such as HTTP 1.1 or FTP. Those servers are
designed to either start their own sequencer stack (stand-alone mode), or integrate in a stack you provide
(e.g. when you start multiple servers or use the server concurrently with <a
href="_summary@lib.vision.html">Vision</a>).
</p>

<p>
Currently only a minimal <a href="_summary@lib.net.servers.http.html">HTTP server</a> is provided. The
tutorial gives an instance of this server in stand-alone mode. We call it Papoose :-)
</p>



<a name="technical"><h3>Technical aspects</h3></a>

<p>
The net cluster is quite simple.
</p>

<ul>

 <li>The <a href="index/ADDRESS.html"><code>ADDRESS</code></a> class is an abstract class that represents an
  address. There are three implementations, in the `address' sub-cluster.</li>

 <li>The <a href="index/ACCESS.html"><code>ACCESS</code></a> class is an abstract class that represents an
  access. There are three implementations, in the `access' sub-cluster.</li>

 <li>The <a href="index/SOCKET_INPUT_OUTPUT_STREAM.html"><code>SOCKET_INPUT_OUTPUT_STREAM</code></a> is a
  bi-directional stream. You cannot create such an object directly, it must be given to you either by <a
  href="index/ACCESS.html"><code>ACCESS</code></a><code>.stream</code> (client usage) or by the server
  (server usage: when an inbound connection occurs, agents are given a stream).</li>

 <li>The <a href="index/SOCKET_SERVER.html"><code>SOCKET_SERVER</code></a> is the basic implementation of a
  server. It is a <a href="index/JOB.html"><code>JOB</code></a> in the `sequencer' terminology, hence it has
  to be used in conjunction with a <a href="index/LOOP_STACK.html"><code>LOOP_STACK</code></a>.</li>

 <li>The <a href="_summary@lib.net.low_level.html"><code>lib/net/low_level</code<</a> cluster contains really
  low-level classes, that should be used only by the cluster itself. Use at your own risk.

  <ul>

   <li><a href="index/SOCKET.html"><code>SOCKET</code></a> is the basic implementation of a socket.</li>

   <li><a href="index/SOCKET_HANDLER.html"><code>SOCKET_HANDLER</code></a> allows low-level access to a <a
    href="index/SOCKET.html"><code>SOCKET</code></a>. Usual code doesn't need that, only the cluster itself
    should use this class.</li>

   <li><a href="index/SOCKET_PLUG_IN.html"><code>SOCKET_PLUG_IN</code></a> is the Eiffel side of the net
    plugin.</li>

  </ul></li>
</ul>

    connections. It will be used in a future release.
