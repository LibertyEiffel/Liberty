deferred class INTERNALS
   --
   -- INTERNALS serves as a gateway between the typed ideal world of Eiffel objects and the untyped physical
   -- world of raw memory, files on disks, streams on networks...
   --
   -- All instances of INTERNALS must be of type TYPED_INTERNALS. Each INTERNALS object describes the physical
   -- structure of exactly one type. For instance, TYPED_INTERNALS[STRING] describes the physical structure of
   -- class STRING.
   --
   -- Optionally, an object of an INTERNAL's associated type can be attached to that INTERNAL. The INTERNAL
   -- can then be used to inspect and change the values of the attributes of the attached object.  For
   -- instance, a STRING could be attached to a TYPED_INTERNALS[STRING]. The TYPED_INTERNALS[STRING] could
   -- then be used to get or set this STRING's attributes.
   --
   -- This class is meant as a very basic building block. Please read the following advice to use INTERNALS
   -- wisely:
   --
   -- # Don't use INTERNALS
   --
   -- # If rule 1 is inapplicable, use INTERNALS to build a higher-level abstraction, and use that abstraction
   -- in your application. You really don't want INTERNALS scattered around your application code.
