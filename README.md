Liberty Eiffel
==============

Liberty is the GNU compiler for the Eiffel programming language, a
continuation of the SmartEiffel compiler. We want to retain from
SmartEiffel its rigour; but not its rigidity. Think of Liberty as
SmartEiffel down from its ivory tower.

It is a complete, small and fast Eiffel compiler, including an
Eiffel to C compiler, documentation tools, a pretty printer, a
debugger and various other tools.

It also includes a large library of classes distributed under the
terms of the MIT/X Consortium License and a comprehensive set of
wrappers/bindings for widespread Free-Software libraries.

Eiffel is an advanced object-oriented programming language that
emphasizes the design and construction of high-quality and reusable
software. 

Liberty is free as in freedom. We want people to contribute to Liberty
from the start.

So please, do join us to give Eiffel the leading position it should
have won twenty years ago :-)
